# YoutubeToMP3
Converts a YouTube Playlist to mp3 files, this allows you to listen to music without the internet or ads.

# Steps to Start Downloading
1. Make sure you change the "path" variable to where ever you want your play list to download
2. To get the correct playlist link just copy the link to the playlist page (NOT while it is playing videos, it should just be a list of videos)
3. I ran it using PyCharm, but you could change it to run from any IDE
4. You will need to install the selenium, os, and pytube packages
5. It might take a while depending on playlist size
